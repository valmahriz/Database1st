Database means a information of some entity or customer, which is used to store.Ex. Facebook, insta. We need database because to save a data of customer & provide him when he wants.
File base storage system is hierarchy method which stores data in computer hardware. Challenges retundancy, security etc.
Data Base Management system is a software is used to store,retrieve, run queries. The needs is it organise your data & give access to users to control data.
Integerity Problems, Security, Concurrent data, compatability, data retudancy, cost are the challenges of file base storage system was tackled by DBMS.
Relational, Hierarchy, distributed, object oriented & network. 
A DBMS can be classification based on the number of users it supports. It can be a single-user database system, which supports one user at a time, or a multiuser database system, which supports multiple users concurrently.
Data model helps create a simplified, logical database that eliminates redundancy, reduces storage requirements, and enables efficient.
The three Schema architecture is a design approach for databases that splits data views into three layers: what users see, the logical structure, and how data is stored.
